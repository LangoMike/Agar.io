# Agar.io - Single Player Edition

A Python-based single-player rendition of the popular web game Agar.io, featuring AI-controlled opponents, advanced split mechanics, and neural network training capabilities.

## Game Overview

Agar.io is a competitive multiplayer game where players control circular blobs that can eat food to grow larger, split into multiple pieces for strategic movement, and consume smaller opponents. This single-player version features intelligent AI adversaries and advanced game mechanics.

### Gameplay Objectives

**Primary Goal**: Grow as large as possible by consuming food and other blobs while avoiding being eaten by larger opponents.

**Victory Conditions**:
- **Eliminate all AI enemies** - Become the last blob standing
- **Reach 20,000 mass** - Achieve massive size dominance
- **Survive as long as possible** - Compete for high scores

**Core Mechanics**:
- **Growth**: Eat food pellets to increase your size and mass
- **Combat**: Consume smaller enemies and avoid larger ones
- **Strategy**: Use splitting to escape danger or hunt smaller prey
- **Survival**: Navigate a world filled with 20 AI opponents

## Features

### Core Gameplay
- **Dynamic Player Movement**: Mouse-based movement with size-based speed scaling
- **Food System**: Varied food sizes (19-55 mass) with probability-based distribution and diminishing returns growth
- **Intelligent Food Consumption**: Only eat food if player is bigger than the food
- **Precise Collision Detection**: Food must be touched at center to be consumed
- **Manual Camera Zoom**: Mouse wheel zoom control (0.10x to 3.0x) for user-defined view adjustment
- **World Boundaries**: Proper world constraints with smooth edge handling
- **Diminishing Returns Growth System**: Logarithmic growth scaling prevents runaway expansion

### Advanced Split Mechanics
- **Multi-Level Splitting**: Split into 2, 4, 8, or 16 blobs (up to 4 splits)
- **Individual Blob Management**: Each split blob tracked independently with individual mass and speed
- **Main Blob Tracking**: Camera follows the designated "main" blob for consistent control
- **Collision Avoidance**: Split blobs automatically avoid overlapping using repulsive forces
- **Individual Growth**: Each split blob can consume food independently, gaining mass in the specific blob that ate it

## Detailed Split Mechanics

### How Splitting Works
1. **Split Trigger**: Press SPACE when your blob is large enough (minimum 40 mass for first split)
2. **Split Process**: Your blob divides into 2 smaller blobs, each with half the original mass
3. **Positioning**: Blobs are positioned on opposite sides to avoid immediate overlap
4. **Individual Control**: All blobs move toward your mouse cursor simultaneously
5. **Independent Growth**: Each blob can eat food independently, growing only that specific blob
6. **Speed Scaling**: Each blob moves at speed based on its individual mass
7. **Collision Avoidance**: Blobs automatically avoid overlapping with each other

### Split Strategy
- **Escape**: Split to escape from larger enemies (smaller blobs move faster)
- **Hunt**: Use multiple blobs to corner and consume smaller enemies
- **Growth**: Split blobs can eat food simultaneously for faster growth
- **Risk Management**: Smaller blobs are more vulnerable to being eaten

### Rejoin Process
1. **Timer**: 30-second countdown begins when you split
2. **Animation**: Last 3 seconds show smooth convergence animation
3. **Dual Movement**: You maintain full control while blobs automatically move together
4. **Final Position**: Rejoin happens at the main blob's current location (no teleportation)
5. **Mass Conservation**: All individual blob masses combine into one large blob

### Split Limitations
- **Maximum Splits**: 4 splits maximum (16 total blobs)
- **Minimum Size**: Each blob must be at least 20 mass to split further
- **Time Limit**: Automatic rejoin after 30 seconds
- **Vulnerability**: Smaller blobs are easier targets for enemies

## Gameplay Tips

5. **Zoom Out**: Use mouse wheel to get a better view of the battlefield

### Advanced Strategies
